- Added "port" configuration support to ORM package.
- Refactorings to bring MySQLDialect and PGSQLDialect classes into alignment with Pear coding standard.
- Bug fix to IdentityManagerImpl::login when using custom non-sql authenticator. Was trying to perform
  a merge operations which is now triggered only if the Authenticator implementation is an instanceof
  DefaultAuthenticator (which means custom sql based authenticators should extend DefaultAuthenticator).
- Bug fix to BasicAuthentication as a result of refactoring Authenticator to static context.
- Added "custom" type to orm.dtd to allow for custom user-defined (postgres) data types.
- Bug fix to logging levels ("error" level conditional was incorrect)
- Bug fix to RestUtil::serverTransform caused by empty array $data. Also fixed several logging directives
  which were referencing old "MimeUtil" class name.
- Bug fix to mysql, mssql, and pgsql dialect "find" - using hard coded foreign model class name instead
  of the configured column/property value in orm.xml.
