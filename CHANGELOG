----

- Fix warning message in AnnotationParser::get*AsArray methods - was using in_array instead of array_key_exists.
- Bug fix to AnnotatedClass getMethods and getProperties methods. Made $filter argument optional.
- Refactored Remoting component (fixed pass by reference during call time deprecated warning)
- Refactored Logger::write. Unit tests were failing on windows since phpunit CLI has no $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'].
- Added MSSQL support to persistence framework (using ODBC driver). SQL queries and sprocs seem to be working good.
- Began refactoring framework to work in windoze environments.
- Added array size checking code throughout AnnotationParser which was causing notices, warnings, and errors under Win32 IIS and PHP 5.2.12.
