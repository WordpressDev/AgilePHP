- Added "references" attribute to orm.dtd procedure "parameter" elements. This allows
  references to be made to other stored procedures, where the OUT value in the parent
  procedure will be passed as an IN parameter to the referenced procedure. This allows
  associations to be made between stored procedures in a similar fashion as tables/views.
- Added stored procedure reference support to MySQLDialect. Updated orm.xml and agilephp_test_mysql.sql
  schema with new "relational stored procedures", created new "SprocTest" test suite. 

* Still need to finish implementing above functionality into the rest of the SQLDialect classes. 

Backward compatible apidoc: Yes
