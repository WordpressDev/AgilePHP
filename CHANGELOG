-- ***************** --
-- Major Refactoring --
-- ***************** --

- BasePersistence::find No longer returns single results as an object. Now they are returned as a single element array.
- PersistenceManager::createSQL removed, PersistenceManager::executeCountQuery now uses BasePersistence::find instead of raw SQL queries.
- PersistenceManager::setPage no longer passes array of stdClass, but rather an array of domain objects.
- BaseModelXmlController::getResultListAsPagedXML now parses through array of domain models instead of array of stdClass. Now supports intercepted domain models.
- BaseModelXmlController::getResultListAsXML now returns the same data as getResultListAsPagedXml without the pagination node. Now supports intercepted domain models.
- Deleted PersistenceRenderer.
