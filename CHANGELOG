- More fine tuning of MVC::dispatch and MVC::loadController
- Refactored MVC::dispatch caching logic from "die" to "echo and return".
- Refactored AgilePHP::parseXml spl_autoload_register logic
  to prepend to autoload stack rather than append.
- Refactored BaseModelActionController::$xsltRenderer from private to protected
- Cleaned up XSLTRenderer doc comments. Added optional $declaration parameter to
  XSLTRenderer::render and XSLTRenderer::transform. Defaults to false (dont include).
- Bug fix to rarely tested Form::getHTML. Brought into alignment with Form::getXSL.
- Cleaned up test/view/form-example.phtml
- Removed extraneous meta equiv tag from test/remoting-example.html
- Bug fix to BaseModelXslController::getModelListXSL which resulted in malformed
  XSL document when both "display" and "description" atrribute values were missing from
  orm.xml table element.
- Bug fix to BaseModelXslController::getModelAsReadOnlyXSL when rendering foreign keys.
  (there is still a bug here when updating - will fix on next checkin)
