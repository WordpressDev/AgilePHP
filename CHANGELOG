- Bug fix to generator/CreateProject::recursiveCopy. Removed debug exit statement.
- Bug fix to AgilePHP::setDisplayPhpErrors. Now setting to true causes PHP errors to be output.
- Added $agilephp->setDisplayPhpErrors( true ) to generator/CreateProject::createIndexDotPHP.
- Bug fix to #@Password interceptor. Referencing local $parameter variable instead of class property.
- Refactored comments in #@Id and #@Password interceptors.
- Added SQLSRVDialect to persistence package and refactored PersistenceManager to support the new dialect via the driver attribute in persistence.xml
- Added automatic generation of triggers to enforce referential integrity based on persistence.xml in SQLiteDialect.
- Removed replace _ code in ForeignKey in regards to SET_NULL and SET_DEFAULT.
- Added SQLiteDialect::reverseEngineer. Also foreign key SQL syntax to create method.
- Added automatic trigger generation in SQLiteDialect::create to enforce constraints / referential integrity.
- Refactored persistence.dtd so that Table and Column elements are optional. reverseEngineer simply requires a database element.
- Flip flopped ON UPDATE and ON DELETE positions in MySQLDialect::create.
- Added create and refacted reverseEngineer methods in MSSQLDialect.
- Added MSSQL data types to BaseModelActionController::getCastedValue. I think this needs to be removed and the SQL dialect class should be repsonsible
  for type casting. Perhaps the dialect class would pass it off to a DialectTypeCast? class for conversion.
