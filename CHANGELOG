- Refactored AgilePHP::addInterception log message. Now logs the type of
  interception (class, method, property) as well as the name of the interceptor
  and the class::method/property which caused the interception to take place.
- Added static method and field/property parsing support to AnnotationParser and
  interception package.
- Added support to interceptor package for static method interceptions.
- Removed property level interceptor support using __get and __set. All field level
  annotations are executed only when the class is instantiated now.
- Bug fix to Interception::getMethodStubs. Was not accounting for constructors which use
  more than one line to define itself.
- Properties are now copied into InterceptorProxy instances to be more transparent to reflection
  operations. InterceptorProxy can be distinguished by looking for the "interceptedTarget" property
  or the "getInterceptedInstance" method. 
- Refactored BaseDialect::isEmpty to take advantage of property names present in interception proxies.
- Refactored AgilePHP::init - moved frameworkRoot initialization outside of init to allow specifying
  the root before the framework starts up. Refactored test/index.php to set frameworkRoot before starting.
- Bug fix to AnnotationParser caching logic. Also did some cleaning up and streamlining.
- Added caching logic to Annotation facade.
- Bug fix to MVC caching logic.
- Added caching logic to ORMFactory::getXml and ORMFactory::getDatabase.
- Added commented caching logic to IdentityMap. Need to add caching attributes to orm.xml
  configuration objects.
- Bug fix to MVC::dispatch caching logic. $key variable getting overwritten by sanitation logic.
- Bug fixes to test/components/TestComponent.
- Bug fix to AgilePHP::getSource - added namespace to glob
