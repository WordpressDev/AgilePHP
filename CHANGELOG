- Refactored AgilePHP::setDebugMode so that when set to true a call is made to setDisplayPhpErrors.
- Removed all '<?= code from views. Replaced with inline php syntax.
- Removed setDisplayPhpErrors from generator/CreateProject. If logger component is set to level debug
  then setDisplayPhpErrors is called automatically.
- Bug fix to SQLiteDialect::createDeleteRestrictTrigger.
- Refactored Remoting controller so that by invoke* methods no longer return, but rather renders the
  result using AJAXRenderer.
