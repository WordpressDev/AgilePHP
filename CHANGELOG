- Removed singleton instance accessor from validator component. Added private function __clone(). completely static now.
- Bug fix to generator/CreateProject.php when creating persistence.xml file. Invalid XML markup on newly added 'enabled'
  column for Identity table.
- Bug fix to User::setEnabled.
- Refactored Identity::login. Moved exception for account disabled under password check so error is raised in the right order.
- Refactored Form::getHTML and Form::getXSL to create textarea elements with 10 rows.
- Refactored persistence Column class to contain "sanitize" property. Updated persistence.dtd to reflect new attribute.
- Refactored BaseModelXMLController::getModelAsFormXML to fix html entity encode/decode bug.
- Bug fix to Mailer::send (duplicate messages due to header configuration)
- Renamed BaseModelActionController::clearModel to "clear".
- Bug fix to BaseModelXSLController::getModelListXSL to remove trailing forward slash when sort direction is not present
- Moved clear method from BaseModelActionController to BaseModelController.
- Eliminated BaseModelActionController::modelAction. Now invokes actions/methods directly on the object rather than being proxied.
- Refactored all MVC, Form, generator, and test package logic associated with above edit.
