- Bug fix to test/control/RequestParamController.php logger injection
- doc updates and more cleanup (removed a few "return null"s, etc)
- Bug fix to AJAXRenderer::toXML. Now sets empty arrays as an empty XML element.
- Created rest classes responsible for transforming data to domain model's / classes.
	XMLTransformer
	JSONTransformer
	YAMLTransformer (requires PECL yaml package)
  also supports transforming to and from different mime types based on annotations,
  accept and content-type headers. Client can send data in one format and get it back in
  another. Still need to work out aplication/xhtml+xml - xslt? :)
