- Implemented relational stored procedures into PGSQLDialect
- Added getProcedures, addProcedure and setProcedures methods to Database class.
- Slight refactoring (polishing) of MySQLDialect::call
- Added "requestBase" attribute to mvc configuration element in agilephp.xml.
- Added Component::getParam
- Bug fix to Form::getForeignKeySelection where the referenced model name was used in lookup rather than orm configured property name
- Added warning log message in BaseDialect::find when expected foreign key lookup fails
- Bug fix to BaseDialect::delete when deleting many-to-many relationship where the key is both a primary key and foreign key
- DomainModel::persist now returns the last insert id

* Still need to finish implementing relational stored procedures into MSSQLDialect 

Backward compatible apidoc: Yes
