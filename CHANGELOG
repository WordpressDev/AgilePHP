- Using phing moving forward to automate builds, tests, and deployments
- Lots of refactoring of the overall framework:
	- Logger is now static
	- Added #@AfterInvoke method so now interceptors are more in alignment with POSA2
	- Added namespace support!
	- Some bug fixes to BasePersistence (dialect classes need refactoring) and changed how persist/merge happens
	  on models which contain a foreign key reference / object
	- Removed constructor argument from Role object.
	- User object no longer returns a Session or Role instance if a record doesnt exist in the database.
	- Started setting up Atlassian tools at:
