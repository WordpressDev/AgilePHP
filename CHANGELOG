- Added "setComparisonLogicOperator" to PersistenceManager (and slough of classes - this needs some cleaning) to allow <,>,=, and LIKE operators.
- Add search to Base MVC XSLT related classes.
- Changed BaseModelActionController::getCastedValue to protected context so it can be overridden.
- Bug fix to search and list views in regards to maintaining page state
