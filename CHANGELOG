- Refactored BaseModelActionController::__construct to support refactored Role api 
- Security fix (SQL injection vulnerability) in BaseDialect::merge 
- Added "SQL generation override" ability to ORM package. This allows the developer to define
  prepared statements for "persist", "merge", "delete", "get", and "find" operations which when
  present, are used instead of SQL generated by the ORM.
- Refactored BaseModelXmlController::getModelAsFormXML to use $model->get() instead of ORM::find. This
  allows developer defined "get" prepared statement to execute rather than using framework automation.
- Performance mods to IdentityManagerImpl
- Moved MySQLDialect::callReference to BaseDialect::callReference (where it was initially intended to reside)
- Added "relational stored procedure" support to PGSQLDialect::call
- Removed DomainModel::call
- Added abstract StoredProcedure which extends DomainModel
- Added ORMFactory::getConfiguration and ORM::getConfiguration
- Added missing "return" statements to DomainModel and StoredProcedure classes

* Still need to finish implementing relational stored procedures into the rest of the SQLDialect implementations
