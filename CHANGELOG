- Bug (E_WARNING) fix to MVC::init - refactored to static
- Went through the entire framework bringing parenthesis syntax into alignment with
  PEAR coding standard - ($value) instead of ( $value ) and \t (tabs) replaced with
  4 spaces (in annotation package only - still need to do the rest of the framework)  
- Refactored BaseController::renderer from private to protected
- Added BaseController::set as shorthand/alias for getRenderer()->set
- Removed private $renderer field from Updated test/control/AJAXController.php
- Performance optimization to Database::hasTables.
- Refactored IPv4Validator and EmailValidator to use filter_var
- Created IPv6Validator using filter_var
- Deleted webservice/remoting/json.js (developer can download from json.org if necessary)

Backward compatible apidoc: Yes
