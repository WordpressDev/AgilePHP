- Lots of performance refactoring
  - agilephp.xml is now optional
  - annotation parsing is now optional (<annotations/> in agilephp.xml to enable - default is disabled)
  - AgilePHP and MVC classes are completely static
  - More tweaking to interceptors
  - Updated unit tests, studio package and apidoc comments
- Bug fix to AnnotatedMethod. Added magic __wakeup method to construct
  the parent class to prevent "reflection object not found" error
  when the class is unserialized.

benchmarking broke into 3500 requests per second (non fcgi) for
a total of ~2500% performance increase with caching enabled. The
core framework without caching is seeing ~900% performance increase.
