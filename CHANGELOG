- Bug fix to InterceptorProxy. Interceptors which return null were resulting in
  an assumption that no interception took place. Now interceptors that return null
  result in null being returned to the caller.
- Abstracted #@Cache interceptor to allow configurable "CacheProvider" implementations.
- CacheProvider interface along with FileCacheProvider, XCacheProvider, and ApcCacheProvider
  implementations. #@Cache defaults to FileCacheProvider.
- Added cache element with provider attribute to agilephp.dtd so #@Cache interceptor
  can be pre-configured in agilephp.xml
- Added delete .cache directory operation to build.xml test and clean targets since
  chown/chmod bug was fixed with new caching abstraction layer.
- Bug fix to AgilePHP; when running under xcache, FrameworkException was not being autoloaded.
  FrameworkException has now been moved to its own class and is the first class included.
