- Bug fix to MSSQLDialect::find. When performing recursive 'find' operations on foreign key / child classes, the
  foreign key lookup was overwriting the parent lookup, causing the returned model to only have one record / row
  in the result set.
- Added exception handler support to AgilePHP Remoting.
