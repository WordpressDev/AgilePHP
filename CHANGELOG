- Refactored test/BaseTest.php and test/index.php for easier testing between *nix and windoze.
- Bug fix to src/identity/User.php. roleId accessor/mutator got added twice resulting in 'Cannot redeclare User:: ...'
- Created #@Cache interceptor.
- Bug fix to MVC::processRequest regex. This one works on linux and windows.
- Refactored test/view/admin.phtml to have dynamic url to load agilephp js file.
- Removed special handling of 'bit' data type from BaseModelActionController::setModelValues. Password hashing logic replaced by model interceptor #@Password. 
- Commented out BasePersistence::merge code that was ignoring values without a value. Now they are included in the UPDATE statement and set to NULL.
- Created BaseModelActionController::setForeignModels to handle applying foreign key values by creating an instance of the foreign model, settings its values
  and then applying the foreign model to its parent using its mutator method.
- Created #@Id interceptor responsible for populating a domain model ActiveRecord when its mutator is invoked.
- Refactored BaseModelActionController::setModelValues
- Refactored contructor in src/identity/User to __construct rather than 'User' so it can be used with interceptions.
- Commented InterceptorProxy::getInstance() method. get_class( self ) is causing an issue in some situations.
- Added callee property and mutator to InvocationContext which provides PHP stack state information about the code that caused the interception.
- Added #@Password interceptor responsible for hashing a method's parameter value using the AgilePHP Crypto component.
- Removed logic from Identity::setPassword to encrypt the passwords. Use #@Password interceptor instead moving forward.
- Refactored AgilePHP_Exception to support file and line parameters.
- Removed type casting from User::setRoles since it was causing an issue with the #@Id interceptor when setting a null value. Now srgument detauls to empty array.
- Commented $findAll parameter and associated logic in PersistenceManager::find.
- Refactored BasePersistence::isEmpty to exclude methods named 'getInstance'. This was causing issues with intercepted models since the proxy contains a singleton
  accessor.
- Refactored try/catch into BaseModelController::getResultListAsModels so if plural instance of foreign key mutator isnt present its logged instead of blowing up.
- Bug fix to BasePersistence::execute and BasePersistence::persist so PHP null's and string literal 'NULL' values get stored as SQL null's.
- Bug fix to BaseModelXslController::getModelFormXSL. Using model defined in controller to create form instead of SQL query.
- Added logic to attempt creating directory heirarchy in Upload::setDirectory if the specified directory doesnt exist.
- Refactored Upload::save to use DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR instead of hard coded forward slash.
- Refactored test/control/InventoryController to use framework Upload component and dynamic paths.
- Got rid of BaseModelController::getResultListAsModels.
