- Refactored Log class to final.
- require_once on many framework components so they dont incur processing overhead going through the autoload
- Fixed pgsql find bug in regards to pagination (limit and offset)
- Renamed persistence package to orm and began on overhaul process:
	- broke sqlite and mssql dialect :(
	- mysql and postgres dialects working :)
	- Columns support "lazy" configuration in orm.xml
	- ORMFactory provides a consistent connection to a "main" application via singleton and can also create
	  additional dialect instances. This allows multiple database servers / connections to be used within a
	  single application.
	- Removed support for multiple databases per "persistence.xml"
	- persistence.xml is now orm.xml
	- "orm.xml" path can be explicitly defined now, allowing multiple database configurations to be isolated.
	  this also helps in terms of scalability since an application can break apart large databases into multiple
	  files so each page hit does not require reading in a massive file before processing starts.
	- Persist/merge operations now happen recursively unless lazy="true" is set on the column in orm.xml
	- Foreign key columns now map directly to referenced models
- Updated all core framework, test, and studio references in regards to persistence package to now point to ORM
- User and Role models now allow constructor arguments. This provides a way to set values without causing
  an interception to happen when calling setUsername and setName. This should be made a convention to handle all
  objects of this nature.
- FileLogger now logs the remote users ip instead of the app name
- updated mvc package to use new ORM
- Renamed AgilePHP_Exception to FrameworkException
