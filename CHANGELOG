- Added $type variable to AgilePHP::import to allow loading of components as well as classes
- Created #@Audit interceptor
- Refactored InterceptorProxy #@AfterInvoke logic - needs more performance tuning and possibly debugging
- Refactored AgilePHP::import to be static and also support loading of components as well as classes.
- Created Component and ComponentParam classes along with a component.dtd which still needs some debugging
  since validation is currently failing.
