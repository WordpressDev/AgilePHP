- Added php namespace support to AJAXRenderer::toXML and XmlRenderer::render.
- Collapsed AJAXRenderer and data/renderer/* functionality and deprecated AJAXRenderer
  methods. Will remove in a later release.
- Bug fix to Upload component when move_uploaded_file failed resulting in undefined $error variable.
- Two bug fixes to BaseModelXslController (getModelFormXSL and getModelListXSL) in regards to
  new many-to-many relationship support refactoring.
- Added logic to BaseDialect::validate to skip validation on required blob columns (file upload) during
  updates, otherwise, users would be forced to re-upload their image when updating other fields.
- Bug fix to BaseDialect::find - offset, orderby, etc is now cleared on both conditions instead of only
  on distinct queries.
