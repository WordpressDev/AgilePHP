- Removed return statement from #@WSDL::createWrappedMethod.
- Refactored AgilePHP_RemotingException to use public properties. This keeps the ->setAccessible reflection call in AJAXRenderer
  from invoking when exceptions are thrown (and eliminates the ->setAccessible error on versions of PHP < 5.3).
- Refactored AgilePHP.js client side library so that XHR.request and XHR.post methods now return eval'd results instead of the raw XMLHTTPRequest object.
- Added Interception::getMethodStubs to overcome the issue of reflection on InterceptorProxy (intercepted classes) masking the real/intended object. Now
  a set of method stubs are created that match the intercepted class, which simply forward the invocation to __call.
- Bug fix to SessionScope::setSessionId. Refactoring needed to support change to persistence find() method returning single record as an array.
- Refactored Identity component so that it does not manually include Role class, since it now contains an #@Id interceptor and needs to be
  created by the Interception component.
- Added test package views to register and added controller methods to LoginController to support the registration / confirmation process.
- Refactored AJAXRenderer::toXML to support multi-dimensional arrays and array of objects.
- Added RestfulTestAPI test package.
- Added generator SetProject to allow setting an already existent project. (Eventually the entire generator package will be replaced by web based IDE)
- Deleted InterceptionReflection class. No longer needed since intercepted class methods are copied into InterceptorProxy.
- Created RestfulTestAPI in test package to demonstrate a simple rest style web service using the MVC and AJAXRenderer.
