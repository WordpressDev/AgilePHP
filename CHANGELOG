- Bug fix to test/control/users::deleteUser controller #@DELETE
- Refactored Role; Added id field which is now the primary key instead of name
- Refactored test/phpunit/UserRestServiceTest to use new ORM, DomainModel, and cascade options.
- Refactored BaseDialect::persist and BaseDialect::merge to automatically persist foriegn
  model instances which do not have a primary key value present. This assumes the foreign model
  primary key is an auto-increment. PDO::getLastInsertId is called after the persist operation
  and passed to the foriegn model instance primary key mutator.
- Refactored IdentityTests to work with new ORM API and cascade option
- Updated SQL schemas to reflect new role design
- Refactored Identity::setRoles to static contenxt
- Refactored Identity::addRole to static contenxt
- Added optional "sequence" attribute to orm.xml column element to handle pgsql sequences.
- Added getLastInsertId to SQLDialect interface, BaseDialect, and ORM classes.
- Added logic to BaseDialect::persist and BaseDialect::merge operations to track the "lastInsertId"
  for parent or child insert statements. Also added logic to support custom/specified pgsql sequence names. 
- Updated all test/*.sql schemas to reflect new user/role relationship. This is still not complete; Will
  be refactoring user/role relationship from many-to-one to many-to-many on the next commit.
