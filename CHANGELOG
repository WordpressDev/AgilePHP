- Few more optimizations on AgilePHP and MVC classes
- Finished adding in phar support to the core framework
  (autoloading, annotation parsing, and interceptions)
  in preparation of phar components.
- Added prepended autoloader to Component class.
- Removed Component::dispatch method and replaced with
  Component::dispatch (still need to create a helper
  class to ease component front controller integration
  with existing Base* mvc classes).
- Added TestPhar phar archive component to test/control
  and added its source to test/components/TestPhar/TestPhar-src.tar.gz
- Added PHP namespace support to BaseModelXslController::getModelAsReadOnlyXSL
