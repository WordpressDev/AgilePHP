- Bug fix to Remoting::decode. One too many stripslashes for windows liking.
- Refactored Remoting::captureErrors ereg to preg_match to fix deprecation warning.
- Added constructor parameter support to Interception.
- Refactored the remoting component and client side javascript library - lots of optimizations
  and now allows callback methods to be set for each remote method call rather than one callback
  for the whole stub.
- Windows compatibility refactoring on IDE code thus far.
- Removed urldecode from RequestScope::sanitize.
