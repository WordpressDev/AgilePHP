- Added interceptor support to Component class.
- Added DomainModel, ActiveRecord, and IdentityMap to ORM package. IdentityMap fixes
  inefficient/duplicate lookups/queries issue.
- Added new "get" method to BaseDialect (havent added to SQLDialect interface yet
  which means only mysql and sqlite dialects will work properly when get() is called)
  which is designed to fetch a single record. This fetch is also performed "through"
  the new IdentityMap.
- Refactored test package and core framework models to implement new ActiveRecord interface.
- Added new classes/interfaces to AgilePHP static classmap.

Backward compatible apidoc: Yes
