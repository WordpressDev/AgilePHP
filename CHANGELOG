- Changed all SQL datetime data types from date( 'c' ) to date( 'Y-m-d H:i:s' ). Effected classes are:
	o Identity
	o User
	o SessionScope
	o Session
    ? Should persistence dialect classes be responsible for formatting? Should an interceptor be responsible?
      Check out test/classes/interceptors/SQLDateTime.php for an example interceptor.
- Refactored legacy persistence find method to use prepared statements instead of a raw SQL query.
- Slight mods to test package. Logic that parsed platform (windows/*nix) and admin.phtml notice on $content variable.
- Added MVC::loadController method to ensure requested controller is loaded from the web application control directory ONLY.
- Refactored MVC::processRequest. No longer uses reflection to invoke controllers as it caused a ReflectionException
  on controllers which were intercepted since the InterceptorProxy does not actually contain the method being invoked.
- Refactored AnnotationParser so that all methods and properties are static.
- Removed test/classes/AJAXController as it was causing autoload issues with AJAXController in test/control.
- Refactored Logger component to use DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR instead of hard coded forward slashes
- Refactored all generator classes to use PHP_EOL instead of hard coded \n new lines.
- Refactored generator/CreateProject to convert AgilePHP framework classes from \n to PHP_EOL when copying
  core framework classes to new project.
- Refactored src/annotation/AnnotationParser::parse to implode on PHP_EOL instead of hard coded \n line seperator.
