- Deleted obsolete IdentityUtils::getMailHeaders. Replaced by Mailer.
- Renamed SqlSessionProvider to OrmSessionProvider (allows polymorphism with future ORM data sources)
- Identity model now stored in SessionScope instead of just username. Entire Identity state is restored
  from SessionScope now rather than doing a lookup for the IdentityModel state with each request. Authenticator
  is freed from managing sessions and focus is put on authentication and role assignments.
