- Added nchar to orm.dtd and studio NewModelRemote class
- Bug fix to BaseModelXslController::getModelListXSL. In the case of "one-to-many" or
  "many-to-one" relationships, the generated XSL expected parent model field name(s)
  to be named after the foreign model class. Now, all values are looked up from orm.xml
  to ensure proper mapped names are respected.
- Minor performance enhancements to IdentityManagerFactory.
- Bug fix to BaseDialect::merge when persisting a foreign key and 'cascade' is null or set to 'none'.
- Bug fix to BaseModelActionController::setModelValues when submitting "NULL" foreign key values
  from HTML select submission
- Refactored XmlRenderer so that child objects are rendered as the parent field name rather than the
  child class name. This was refactored to support #2 mentioned above.
- Bug fix to Interception::getPropertyStubs on windows and mac servers
- Refactored Identity::setOrderBy to allow for optional "direction" parameter. Defaults to ASC now.
- Added 'transformer' annotation parameter to #@RequestParam.
- Refactored abstract Validator class to interface. validate() method is now static.
- Refactored BaseDialect::validate to work with new Validator API.
- Created ValidationException class and added its file system path to AgilePHP::classmap.
- Added optional validator parameter to #@RequestParam interceptor
- Bug fix to #@Restrict interceptor that was introduced when Role entity was refactored to support an "id" field.
- Added debug logging in RestUtil::consumeTransform to avoid eatting the root cause exception stack before throwing

Studio Updates
- Added MSSQL nchar support to NewModelRemote. Need to come up with a way to dynamically load data types based on DTD.

Backward compatible apidoc: No
- Validators are called statically now.
