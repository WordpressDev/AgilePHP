- Big fixes to JsonRenderer.
	- Empty arrays are now rendered as "[]" instead of null.
	- JSON structure is now created using the actual model structure, instead of using child class name for parent property names.
- Added additional $params argument to ORM to support MSSQLDialect sqlsrv_query.
- Bug fix to BaseDialect::delete in the case of a table with multiple primary keys which are also foriegn keys (junction table) 
- Enhanced Remoting by allowing callbacks to be specified as the last parameter to the remote method call. The 'setCallback' method
  in the generated javascript stub is still supported.
