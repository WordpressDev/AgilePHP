- Added "cascade" attribute option to foreignKey orm.xml configuration element to allow
  user defined actions to take when encountering parent/child relationships. Supports
  the following actions "none", "all", "persist-merge", "delete".
- Refactored orm unit tests so that mysql test uses cascade="all", pgsql uses
  cascade="persist-merge", sqlite uses cascade="delete" and mssql uses cascade="none".
- Removed Table::getSelectedColumn. Removed Column::selectable. Not used anymore.
- Non-static method XmlToModel::convert() should not be called statically bug fix
- Refactored IdentityTest and UserRestServiceTest to work in alignment with new orm.xml
  cascade option.
- Updated test/phpunit/phpunit.xml to include rest and i18n tests
- Updated test/view/admin_navigation.phtml to include rest and soap tests. removed UserRole
  many-to-many logic for now - will circle back to implement when have time to update sql
  files and unit tests.
- Refactored ORMFactory::getDatabase to static context.
- Added #@Transactional class/method level interceptor responsible for automatically
  beginning, comitting, and rolling back transactions.
- Refactored BaseDialect::commit and BaseDialect::rollback so that debug messages are
  emitted only after the action has been performed. Commit try/catch now calls rollback()
  now instead of throwing an ORMException (rollback will attempt to roll back the transaction
  if left open and then raise the ORMException "there is already an active transaction")
- Added #@Transactional interceptor to AgilePHP::$classmap
- Scratched ORM items from TODO list
- Added hasTransactionInProgress method to SQLDialect and ORM facade.
- Created test case for new #@Transactional interceptor in test/phpunit/InterceptorTest.php
- Performance optimizations to AnnotationParser (regexs replaced with str_replace and strpos
  where possible)
- Added try/catch to InterceptorProxy::__destruct so that exceptions are sent to the log file
  rather than dying with an "Unknown stack" error.
