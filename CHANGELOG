- Bug fix to AgilePHP.js AgilePHP.Remoting.Stub.prototype.invoke*. Synchronous mode failed due to returning new* instead of the already existing instance.
- Added return statement to Remoting::create*Stub methods to support synchronous calls.
- Fixed PHP notice in RequestScope::__construct when no request token is present.
- Added support for RPC/LITERAL and DOCUMENT/LITERAL soap services. #@WSDL interceptor is getting complicated - perhaps split into formatting classes?
