- Bug fix to Form::getHTML and Form::getXSL $action variables. Updated
  to use $this->getMode() as initially intended.

- Bug fix to BaseModelXslController::getModelFormXSL(). Empty find result
  was causing the returned null result to be passed into the Form constructor
  resulting in an exception. Now if the find comes back empty $model is set to
  the $model defined in the action Controller.
  
- Bug fix to Form::getXSL. Textarea needed xsl:value-of element instead of xpath. Also
  xsl:if statement was added to test for null database value and if so, add an xsl
  comment inside of the textarea to keep the if element from collapsing
  
- Bug fix to Form::getForeignKeySelection. Search results containing a single row
  were not displaying due to foreach loop expecting an array (multiple items). Added
  else if to check to test result as object type and if so, display the single item.
  
- Updated Column::getViewDisplayName so that column names are returned as a proper name

- Bug fix to Form::getForeignKeySelection. Error occurred when foreign model instance accessor
  was null.
  
- Removed &#8201; from both Form::getHTML and Form::getXSL. Was causing strange characters to appear
  in some cases.

- Bug fix to AgilePHP.MVC javascript object. processRequest now uses its parameters property
  instead of an argument.
  
- Refactored AJAXRenderer::toJSON so that the object name is no longer returned.

- Bug fix to Form::getXSL. Textarea is now formatted using mbstring to ensure encoding integrity.

- Refactored BaseModelActionController::setModelValues() from private to protected. Same with setPrimaryKeys.

- Refactored BaseModelActionController::__construct to throw AgilePHP_NotLoggedInException and AgilePHP_AccessDeniedException
  instead of just AgilePHP_NotLoggedInException with different messages. Also remoked private revokeAccess method.

- Bug fix to Identity::resetPassword. Was using invalid session handle resulting in invalid object error.

- More work on generator. Big ones are now CreateModel is not munging up persistence.xml configuration to it can
  be reliably used to create models and now projects can be created with Eclipse Galileo PHP and Netbeans 6.7.1 support.

- Added LICENSE and CHANGELOG to project
