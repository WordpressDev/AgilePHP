** AgilePHP Studio **
---------------------
AgilePHP Studio is still under heavy development. It's somewhat functional at the moment :) Heres what works:

1) Create Projects
2) Manipulate file system under the "workspace"
3) Upload files into the workspace (should probably add an unzip option, huh)
4) Code editor w/ save ability using CTRL + S (NOTE: Code mirror seems buggy. Need to find a new editor?)
5) Reverse engineer  to create database
6) Reverse engineer database to create 
7) Create controllers (basic, model controller, custom template)
8) Create views (basic, custom template)
9) Download components from appstore.makeabyte.com
10) Manage component configuration once downloaded and installed.
11) Integration with PEAR and PECL (in progress, but does show current installed extensions)


---------------------
** PHPUnit Testing **
---------------------
To use the testing packages and TDD features install PHP Unit 3 via PEAR.

pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
