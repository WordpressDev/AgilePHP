** Building **
--------------
To execute build.xml targets, install Phing via PEAR.

pear channel-discover pear.phing.info
pear install phing/phing

Bug fix to phing/tasks/ext/pearpackage/Fileset.php
line 59      if (!is_array($options)) {
line 60                $options = $options->getOptions();
line 61        }

Bug fix to phing/Phing.php 
line 1016    $pieces = explode( DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $path );
line 1017    $class = preg_replace( '/\.php/', '', array_pop( $pieces ) );
line 1018    if( class_exists( $class, false ) ) return;

Apply note to Phing.php - on line 1270, comment the following line to use php.ini memory_limit -1
ini_set('memory_limit', '32M'); // nore: this may need to be higher for many projects

Install JSlint on Ubuntu:

---------------------
** AgilePHP Studio **
---------------------
AgilePHP Studio is still under heavy development. It's somewhat functional at the moment :) Heres what works:

1) Create Projects
2) Manipulate file system under the "workspace"
3) Upload files into the workspace (should probably add an unzip option, huh)
4) Code editor w/ save ability using CTRL + S (NOTE: Code mirror seems buggy. Need to find a new editor?)
5) Reverse engineer  to create database
6) Reverse engineer database to create 
7) Create controllers (basic, model controller, custom template)
8) Create views (basic, custom template)
9) Download components from appstore.makeabyte.com
10) Manage component configuration once downloaded and installed.
11) Integration with PEAR and PECL (in progress, but does show current installed extensions)


---------------------
** PHPUnit Testing **
---------------------
To use the testing packages and TDD features install PHP Unit 3 via PEAR.

pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

Update AgilePHP/test/BaseTest.php to use your file system structure when executing unit tests.
Update AgilePHP/test/index.php to use your file system structure when executing browser based tests.


-------------------
** phpDocumentor **
-------------------
To have Phing output apidocs, install phpDocumentor via PEAR.

pear install phpDocumentor XML_Beautifier


----------
** YAML **
----------
To get YAML working on PHP 5.3 under ubuntu 10.04:

apt-get install libyaml-0-2 libyaml-dev
pecl install yaml


---------------------
**    Debugging    **
---------------------
Debug using FirePHP:

pear channel-discover pear.firephp.org
pear install firephp/FirePHPCore
