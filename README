** TODO **
----------
 > Add constructor argument support to InterceptorProxy
 > Iron out RequestScope CSFR issues in regards to destroying session
  > Persistence framework needs to support many-to-many relationships
 > Need to revisit PersistenceRenderer and make an easy way to
   allow different client side rendering libraries like jquery, dojo, extjs, etc (adapter?)
 > Add calendar, spinner, date picker, and other widgets to persistence rendering
 > AJAX Push / Comet (PHP socket daemon?)
 > Create dialect classes for the following database servers:
 	pgsql
	firebird
	informix
	oracle
	dblib
	ibm
 > Finish Form::toJSON method (this should probably use AJAXRenderer)
