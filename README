------------------
** Requirements **
------------------
PHP 5.3+


---------------------------------------
** Required Extensions By Components **
---------------------------------------
--with-apxs2				(Dynamic apache support)
--with-pdo-<database type>	(required for each database you want to use)
--enable-mbstring			(XML/XSLT controllers use this to convert data to entities)
--with-gettext				(i18n Internationalization)
--with-xsl					(Controllers involved with XSLT)
--with-mcrypt				(Crypto encrypt/decrypt methods)


---------------------
** PHPUnit Testing **
---------------------
To use the testing packages, and TDD features, install PHP Unit 3 via PEAR.

pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

Update AgilePHP/test/BaseTest.php to use your file system structure when executing unit tests.
Update AgilePHP/test/index.php to use your file system structure when executing browser based tests.


---------------------
**    Debugging    **
---------------------
Debug using FirePHP:

pear channel-discover pear.firephp.org
pear install firephp/FirePHPCore 


----------
** TODO **
----------
 > Add constructor argument support to InterceptorProxy
 > Iron out RequestScope CSFR issues in regards to destroying session
 > Persistence framework needs to support many-to-many relationships
 > Need to revisit PersistenceRenderer and make an easy way to
   allow different client side rendering libraries like jquery, dojo, extjs, etc (adapter?)
 > Add calendar, spinner, date picker, and other widgets to persistence rendering
 > AJAX Push / Comet (PHP socket daemon?)
 > Create dialect classes for the following database servers:
 	pgsql
	firebird
	informix
	oracle
	dblib
	ibm
 > Finish Form::toJSON method (this should probably use AJAXRenderer)
 > Need to update MSSQLDialect::find to use LIKE clause for text, ntext, and image data types.
 > Need to add support to persistence/Column for multiple foreign keys per column
 > Complete reverse engineering logic in dialect classes and generator/ReverseEngineerDatabase.
 > Add support for database diff's.
 > Add SOAP support for DOCUMENT/LITERAL wrapped
 
 --------------------------
 ** Windows Specific TODO's
 --------------------------
 > Use DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR instead of / in references to the file system
 > Use \r\n instead of \n for new lines

 **      Known Bugs      **
 --------------------------
Issue: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Function sequence error
Reason: This happens when using ODBC driver on SQL Server 2000 to insert/update datetime fields.
Resolution: Upgrade SQL Server to newer version
Resolution: If running on a windows server, specify 'SQLSRV' as the MSSQL driver and the persistence framework will
			use the SQLSRVDialect class to perform persistence operations. This requires the "Microsoft SQL Server Driver for PHP 1.1"
See: http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2005/en/us/PHP-Driver.aspx.
See: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40452

Issue: Clicking on sortable column headers rendered by mvc/XSLTRenderer breaks in some cases when using MSSQLDialect class.
Reason: The text, ntext, and image data types cannot be compared or sorted, except when using IS NULL or LIKE operator.
Resolution: Need to update MSSQLDialect class to use LIKE clause for column types listed above.
