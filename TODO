** TODO **
----------
> Iron out RequestScope CSFR issues in regards to destroying session and making requests from client side javascript.
> ORM framework needs to support many-to-many relationships
> Need to revisit ORM renderer and make an easy way to
   allow different client side rendering libraries like jquery, dojo, extjs, etc (adapter?)
> Add calendar, spinner, date picker, and other widgets to ORM rendering
> Start looking into  "HTML 5" WebSocket API for two-way communication between client and server
> Create dialect classes for the following database servers:
    firebird
    informix
    oracle
    dblib
    ibm
> Fix mssql and sqlite dialect classes since orm revamp. Trash MSSQLDialect and rename SQLSRVDialect to MSSQLDialect.
> Finish unit tests in ORM package
> Finish Form::toJSON method (this should probably use AJAXRenderer)
> Finish creating unit tests for all framework components (naughty, naughty - TDD!)
