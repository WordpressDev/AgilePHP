> Iron out RequestScope CSFR issues in regards to destroying session and making requests from client side javascript.
> ORM framework needs to support many-to-many relationships

      allow different client side rendering libraries like jquery, dojo, extjs, etc (adapter?)
> Add calendar, spinner, date picker, and other widgets to ORM rendering
> Create Oracle dialect class

> Finish creating unit tests for all framework components (naughty, naughty - TDD!)
> Create ActiveDirectoryAuthenticator, OpenLdapAuthenticator, OpenIdAuthenticator to Identity package
> Create MemcacheSessionProvider, ApcSessionProvider classes.
> Abstract out #@Cache interceptor to support configurable providers (MemcacheCacheProvider, FilesystemCacheProvider, etc)
> Move all core framework packages into PHP namespaces (still have some backward compatibility to maintain w/ 5.2)
> Refactor all classes into alignment with PEAR coding standard
> Add code sniffer and copy/paste detector to build.xml
> Integrate PHPUnit and Bamboo
> Integrate PHPUnit and Clover
