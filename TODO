** TODO **
----------
> Iron out RequestScope CSFR issues in regards to destroying session and making requests from client side javascript.
> Persistence framework needs to support many-to-many relationships
> Need to revisit PersistenceRenderer and make an easy way to
   allow different client side rendering libraries like jquery, dojo, extjs, etc (adapter?)
> Add calendar, spinner, date picker, and other widgets to persistence rendering
> AJAX Push / Comet (PHP socket daemon?)
> Create dialect classes for the following database servers:
    firebird
    informix
    oracle
    dblib
    ibm
> Finish PGSQLDialect
> Finish unit tests in persistence package
> Finish Form::toJSON method (this should probably use AJAXRenderer)
> Need to update MSSQLDialect::find to use LIKE clause for text, ntext, and image data types.
> Finish creating unit tests for all framework components (naughty, naughty - TDD!)
