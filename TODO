** TODO BEFORE BETA LAUNCH **
-----------------------------
> Iron out RequestScope CSFR issues in regards to destroying session and making requests from client side javascript.
> Add calendar, spinner, date picker, and other widgets to ORM rendering
> Create OracleDialect, XmlDialect, and LdapDialect classes for ORM package
> Finish Form::toJSON method (this should probably use JsonRenderer)
> Finish creating unit tests for all framework components (naughty, naughty - TDD!)
> Create and add ActiveDirectoryAuthenticator, OpenLdapAuthenticator, OpenIdAuthenticator to Identity package
> Create MemcacheSessionProvider and MemcacheCacheProvider.
> Refactor all classes into alignment with PEAR coding standard
> Add code sniffer and copy/paste detector to build.xml
> Integrate PHPUnit and Bamboo
> Integrate PHPUnit and Clover
> Complete OpenAppstore/component integration
> Add stored procedure support to component <orm> configurations
> Figure out how to make unit tests use same dbpg session as phpunit/phing
  so tests that rely on "external" curl requests show up in coverage report.
> ORM::persist needs to set primary keys on the same model instance that was passed in to avoid having to make
  a find() or get() operation to access the new id.
