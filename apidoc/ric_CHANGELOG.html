0.15a
-----

- Bug fixes to test package Mailer component. Added test views and a cheesy navigation for demo purposes.
- Created #@BasicAuthentication interceptor which uses HTTP basic authentication to authenticate a visitor.
- Bug fix to Interception::getMethodStubs. Added cleansing of default parameter values.
- Bug fix to Interception logic where interceptors were being executed twice when an interceptor instantiated a class which contains interceptor annotations.
- Removed #@WSDL inProgress check since it only gets executed once now.
- Refactored AgilePHP __autoload and Interception classes to check for loaded classes using class_exists( $class, false ) now. (dont load if doesnt exist)
- Updated test package error.phtml css include. Was point to very old (like v0.1a) file path.
- Refactored test/InterceptorTest to include a test for each interception happening in classes/MockInterceptionTarget.
- Refactoring of comments throughout various classes.
- Refactored #@Password interceptor to include class::method name in log message.
- Refactored test/PersistenceManagerTest to work with find method since find no longer returns single result sets as an object.
- Lots of refactoring on persistence package, specifically PersistenceManager, dialect classes and SQLDialect interface. Also made necessary updates
  to MVC classes, etc, which needed to reflect the new interface. find method now also uses properties set in the model in WHERE clause.
- Removed bit data type explicit checkin from BaseModelXmlController everywhere (ord($value) == 1) logic was being used. Also updated Form class
  so that it also removes all explicit bit checking logic.
- Moved mysql bit type checking into User setEnabled method.
- Removed dynamic model argument from BaseModelActionController::modelList. Also placed additional checking of null view argument and default to admin view.
- Created Column::getColumn( $name )
- Created test/PersistenceManagerTest::testRestrictedFind to test lookups using restrictions logic.
- Bug fix to BaseModelActionController::modelAction 'filteredList' when filtering on an intercepted class. Only methods are copied into InterceptorProxy
  not properties, so this causes a bug when using reflection to enumerate properties on a class which has been intercepted. It seems as though interceptors
  are still being somewhat intrusive to &quot;normal&quot; PHP application logic. Should properties be coped into InterceptorProxy also?
- Updated apidoc to v0.15a.
- Added user enable/disable check to Identity::login.
- Bug fix to Identity::refresh. Still old code using persistence manager find and expecting single result object.
